# This project is intended as a web diary/journal to record our personal experiments as we learn to code music by using strudel library. 
Tough, it still in initial version, it's just record one snippet only. But in the future we will upload this to include as many snippet as can. 
We make Every snippet runnable, means it can play the audio right in the browser, even you can edited it more, thanks to Strudel library. This library provides many music instrument sounds that you can mix and match so it will produce the sounds that you want.
The project we made is web based. For the page appearance we use html and CSS files. To manage how it works with the user input, we use python inside the file of app.py. To run the web application, we use library from flask.
